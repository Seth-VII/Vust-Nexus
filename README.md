# Vust-Nexus

- This is a small learning project for one of my university courses. I did a few test projects in the last 3 months and worked on this one for around 1.5 months now.
I used Macroquad to do the rendering, audio and for some other things to make this project less of a nightmare :D

The Code is probably not as good as it should be since Im still very new to rust and came to this with a background of only working with Unity C#, Unreal C++ and some other experience. 
I may will at more comments, features and content to this project, but it will take some time since my main goal with it got already achieved. 
Hope it is just a small sphattig nightmare for those gonna dig into that code ^_^
